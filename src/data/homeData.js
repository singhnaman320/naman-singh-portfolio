  bio: `I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with hands-on expertise in the MERN stack, dedicated to building scalable, user-centric, and high-performance applications. My journey in development began with a curiosity to understand how things work behind the scenes—evolving into a strong foundation in backend systems, database optimization, and dynamic front-end interfaces. Over time, I have worked on diverse projects ranging from real-time messaging platforms and e-commerce solutions to insurance analytics dashboards, ensuring every product I build is robust, secure, and efficient.
  With experience in modern frameworks, database design, and cloud integrations, I thrive on solving complex challenges and turning ideas into impactful digital solutions. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and collaborating with teams to deliver seamless experiences. For me, full-stack development is not just about connecting front-end and back-end—it's about creating technology that adds real value, scales with growth, and enhances user engagement.`,
